# CS211
CS211 Rutgers w/ Santosh
Course Description

This course covers materials to illustrate how a high level program is converted to binary and is eventually executed by the hardware. We will cover a brief introduction to programming in C, how data and control represented in C is converted to binary and how the binary code is executed by the processor. This will involve programming in C, understanding and debugging X86 assembly, interfaces between the hardware and the software components, organization of hardware and how the various components interact.

    Von Neumann architecture, hardware trends, performance, energy, cost metrics
    Introduction to C programming
    Assembly language techniques and instruction-set design
    Boolean algebra, digital logic
    The memory hierarchy
    Performance
    Input/Output concepts

 

Prerequisites

CS 112 is a pre-requisite for this course.

Textbooks

Required: R.E.Bryant and D.R.O'Hallaron, Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective, Prentice Hall,  Third edition. 
Students can probably also use the second edition of the book.

Recommended: D.A.Patterson and J.L.Hennessy, Computer Organization and Design: The Hardware/Software Interface, Morgan Kauffman

    Note that while this textbook is recommended, we will use portions of it for various lectures.

Recommended for C: B.W.Kernighan and D.M.Ritchie, The C Programming Language, Prentice Hall

    Note that while this is the classic reference for C, there are a number of online references available as well. For example, here is a free C online reference http://publications.gbdirect.co.uk/c_book/
    While you are welcome to use these resources, note that we have not seen them ourselves and cannot attest to the usefulness of these references.

Grading

Midterm exams  -- 15%

Final exam -- 30%

Class participation -- 5%

Programming assignments -- 50%

 

Programming Assignment Policies

There will be numerous programming assignments to improve your understanding of the subject.

Programming assignments will be handed in via Sakai. We will provide instructions for packaging and handing in your assignments. You must follow these instructions exactly. If we cannot compile or run your programs, you will lose a significant portion of points.

We will not accept late assignments. Programming assignments must be handed in by the specified time/date on Sakai.

If you don't already have an account on the Instructional Laboratory cluster go to

https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/resources/instructional-lab

and create one. iLab machines are located in Hill 248, 250, 252, and 254. All registered students have access to these rooms.

In addition, there are a number of references to help you understand how to use the iLab systems. Please look at: 

https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/resources/instructional-lab

You will be using a Unix environment for the programming assignments. For a primer on using the Bash environment, please refer to http://tldp.org/LDP/Bash-Beginners-Guide/html/index.html For an assortment of GNU/Linux command line tools, refer to this: http://www.tldp.org/LDP/GNU-Linux-Tools-Summary/GNU-Linux-Tools-Summary.pdf

Some other manuals that will be useful: http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual

(Emacs) http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/

(Make) http://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/

(Gdb) http://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/documentation

 

Homework Assignment Policies 

Handed in at the lecture. Late assignments will not be accepted.

 

Rules for Collaboration

You are free, even encouraged, to talk to your fellow classmates about your assignments. However, you cannot copy from one another in the assignments. If in doubt, follow Gilligan's Island rule. That is, after a joint discussion of an assignment, each student should discard all notes, go do something mind-numbing for an hour (like watching a couple of episodes of Gilligan's Island), and then recreate the solutions absolutely individually. The idea is to ensure that you fully understand and provide your own solutions, rather than blindly incorporate the solutions from the group discussion. We will use sophisticated plagiarism detection software and report any violation to office of student conduct. 

 

You must also follow the Department's Academic Integrity Policy:

Finally, copying from the web is also cheating.
