Arjun Patel PA4 Report
	The main data structure I used was a 2d array. The rows represent the sets and the 
	nodes in each collumn, the blocks. Prefetching takes the adress adjacent to the one
	being read from memory and inserts it into the cache because it is likely that it 
	will be used. This increases the number of hits and thus the number of reads. This
	was observed as in each case, the number of hits and reads increased with 
	prefetching.
